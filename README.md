## 🚀 Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**  | HTML, CSS, JavaScript (via Flask templates) |

## 🧠 System Architecture

Dokan follows a modular backend-first architecture designed for simplicity and scalability:

- **Flask Backend** handles routing, authentication, business logic, and API responses
- **CSV + Pandas Layer** is used for lightweight data storage and fast prototyping during hackathon development
- **AI Module** processes sales and customer data to generate insights and predictions
- **Template-based Frontend** renders dynamic data using Flask and JavaScript

This separation of concerns allows easy migration to a relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) and REST-based frontend in future iterations.

---

## 🤖 AI & Data Intelligence

Dokan integrates machine learning to enhance decision-making for store owners:

- **Sales Trend Analysis** using historical billing data
- **Demand Prediction** for frequently sold products
- **Customer Sentiment Insights** based on feedback data
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** using Pandas
- **Modeling** using scikit-learn for lightweight prediction tasks

The AI pipeline was designed to be efficient, interpretable, and suitable for small retail datasets.

---

## 📂 Data Storage Design Choice

CSV-based storage was intentionally used during hackathon development to:

- Enable fast iteration without database setup overhead
- Ensure portability and ease of deployment
- Allow quick data analysis using Pandas

The system architecture supports seamless migration to MySQL or PostgreSQL for production-scale deployment.
